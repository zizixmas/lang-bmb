## [Unreleased]

## [0.50.15] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **Bootstrap parser method chain extensions**: Stage 1 native compiler now supports:
  - Method calls on function results: `foo().bar()` → `(mcall (call foo) bar)`
  - Method calls on string literals: `"abc".len()` → `(mcall (str "abc") len)`
  - Method calls on parenthesized expressions: `(x + y).abs()` → `(mcall (+ x y) abs)`
- **parser_ast.bmb v0.32 syntax support**: Added braced if-else parsing alongside pre-v0.32 `then/else` syntax

### Fixed

- **Stage 1 parsing of bootstrap files**: `bootstrap/types.bmb` (8K+ lines) now parses completely with Stage 1 native compiler (requires unlimited stack)

### Known Issues

- Stage 2 self-compilation still limited by LLVM IR variable scoping in nested branches (pre-existing, tracked)
- Requires `ulimit -s unlimited` for large files due to recursive descent parser depth

## [0.50.14] - 2026-01-16

### Changed

- **SLP vectorization enabled**: Added `set_loop_slp_vectorization(true)` to LLVM pass options for better performance on parallel operations.

### Performance

- **Gate #3.1 PASSED** (Clang baseline): fibonacci benchmarks now run at 1.00-1.08x vs Clang -O3
  - fibonacci(35): BMB 0.016s = Clang 0.016s (1.00x)
  - fibonacci(40): BMB 0.183s vs Clang 0.169s (1.08x)
- Binary trees benchmark: 1.39x vs Clang (memory allocation overhead)
- GCC comparison: 1.60-1.83x (GCC has fibonacci-specific optimizations)

### Documentation

- **LLVM codegen analysis**: Documented root cause of performance gap - alloca/load/store pattern vs SSA-form IR generation.
- **Gate #3.1 baseline change**: Recommend Clang-based comparison (same LLVM backend) as official benchmark target.
- **Improvement roadmap**: SSA-form IR generation identified as path to further 15-20% improvement.

## [0.50.13] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **Bootstrap LLVM IR variable scoping bug**: Function parameters were incorrectly renamed with block suffixes (e.g., `%d` → `%d_b2`) in nested else branches, causing undefined variable errors in generated LLVM IR.

### Changed

- Added `params` parameter to all `lower_*_sb` functions in bootstrap LLVM IR generator
- New `extract_param_names` helper extracts parameter names from signature for scoping checks
- `lower_var_sb` now uses `is_param()` to preserve original parameter names across all blocks

### Known Issues

- Stage 2 self-compilation still fails due to stack overflow when processing 30K+ line bootstrap file (pre-existing issue, tracked as v0.46 blocker)

## [0.50.12] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- **Critical performance bug**: LLVM optimization passes were not being run on generated IR, causing 5x slower native code than C. Now runs `default<O2>` or `default<O3>` passes based on optimization level.

### Performance

- **Native code benchmark**: fibonacci(40) improved from 5.15x slower to 2.0x slower than C (gcc -O3). The remaining gap is due to GCC's more aggressive loop unrolling.

### Changed

- Migrated all benchmark files in `ecosystem/benchmark-bmb/` to v0.32 syntax

## [0.50.11] - 2026-01-16

### Security

- **Cyclic type alias detection**: Added DFS-based cycle detection to prevent DoS via infinite recursion in type resolution. Circular definitions like `type A = B; type B = A;` now produce clear error messages.
- **Duplicate function warning**: Compiler now warns when a function is defined multiple times with the same name. Later definitions silently override earlier ones (warning helps catch copy-paste errors).

### Changed

- Extended `type_aliases` HashMap to track definition spans for better error reporting
- Added `function_spans` tracking to TypeChecker for duplicate detection

### Tests

- Added 7 new integration tests for type alias cycles and duplicate function detection

## [0.50.10] - 2026-01-16

### Security

- Completed Security Audit Phase 3: Penetration testing
- Documented all P0/P1 security findings in SECURITY_AUDIT.md

## [0.50.9] - 2026-01-15

### Documentation

- Critical benchmark review and honest status assessment
- Updated roadmap with verification results

## [0.50.8] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- Bootstrap if-else refactoring for reduced parser complexity
- Simplified parser grammar to avoid stack overflow issues

## [0.50.6] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- **Type alias syntax**: `type Name = TargetType;` with generic parameter support
- **Refinement type aliases**: `type NonZero = i64 where self != 0;`
- Type alias resolution in type checker

## [0.50.5] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Expanded integration test suite
- Fixed stdlib constants and type definitions

## [0.50.4] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

## [0.50.3] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Comprehensive integration test suite (65+ tests)
- Test infrastructure for error cases and warning detection

## [0.50.1] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Stdlib postcondition syntax issues
- Bootstrap parser integer/keyword collision bugs

### Documentation

### Added

- Multi-type REPL support
- Lint command with `--strict` flag for treating warnings as errors
- Enhanced warning system

## [0.32.0] - 2025-XX-XX

### Changed

- **Breaking**: New if-else syntax: `if cond { then } else { else }` (Rust-style braces)
- **Breaking**: Comments now use `//` (double-slash), `--` still supported for compatibility
- Added shift operators: `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift)
- Added symbolic logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!` as alternatives to `and`, `or`, `not`
